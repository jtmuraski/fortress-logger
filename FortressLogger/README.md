#Welcome to Fortress Logger

##Introduction
Fortress Logger was created to be a simple and easy to use option for logging application message to the file location of  your choice. The emphasis 
for Fortress Logger is on ease of use - in both configuring it for use within your application, and easy to use while coding as well.

I created Fortress Logger for a couple of reasons - first and foremost, I was not a fan of the ILogger system in C# and .NET, and decided to use my own instead.
After using Fortress Logger in some of my own projects, I decided to make it publicly usable - and to try and make it more useful as a logging tool for numerous
scenarios and situations that developers find themselves in.
